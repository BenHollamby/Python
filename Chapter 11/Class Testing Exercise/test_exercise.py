#Employee: Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should take in a first
#name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes. Write a method
#called give_raise() that adds $5,000 to the annual salary by default but also accepts a different
#raise amount.
#Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods, test_give_default_raise() andtest_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t have to create a new
#employee instance in each test method. Run your test case, and make sure both tests pass.
